### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a final year computer science student at Nottingham Trent University (NTU) and an instructor for [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/) with a passion for programming.

 My primary areas of interest are Artificial Intelligence, [Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jamievoce/predicting-developers-income), and [Performance Optimisation](https://github.com/EvelynVoce/Algorithmic-complexity-analysis-with-optimised-solutions). I've developed a variety of software from [multi-threaded server-clients](https://github.com/EvelynVoce/Concurrent-Client-Server-Model), to chat bots and film recommendation systems.  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an AI chat bot using natural language processing and image recognition
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make API's in python
- âœ¨ Some of my favourite recent projects have been creating a [RESTful API](https://github.com/EvelynVoce/RestFull-messaging-service-API-) in Java along with my work on [Algorithm optimisation](https://github.com/EvelynVoce/Algorithmic-complexity-analysis-with-optimised-solutions) in C++
