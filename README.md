### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a final year computer science student at Nottingham Trent University (NTU) with a passion for programming. My primary areas of interest are Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Performance Optimisation. I've developed a variety of software from multi-threaded server-clients, to chat bots and film recommendation systems. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an AI chat bot using natural language processing
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning RESTful services
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on impactful projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my repositories and past projects
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/evelyn-voce/
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a huge book worm
