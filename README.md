### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Evelyn, a software developer at Rolls Royce, formerly a developer at [Next](https://www.next.co.uk/) and a former course instructor for [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/).

My current area of interest is full-stack development using React and a series of REST APIs. I have created many projects in this area such as an e-commerce site, a mock site for advertising programming courses designed to get LGBTQ+ individuals into tech and a calendar app to display and schedule events for university societies. My other major areas of interest however revolve around [Artificial Intelligence]( https://github.com/EvelynVoce/AI-Chatbot) and [Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jamievoce/predicting-developers-income),


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on furthering my skills as a full-stack developer by using React, C# and SQL to make an online marketplace. Python has since been added to serve as the primary back-end implementation rather than C#
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how AI can be used to help those with disabilities
- âœ¨ Some of my favourite projects have been creating a [RESTful Instant Messaging Service](https://github.com/EvelynVoce/RestFull-messaging-service-API-) in Java along with my work on [Algorithm Optimisation](https://github.com/EvelynVoce/Algorithmic-complexity-analysis-with-optimised-solutions) in C++

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a huge bookworm
